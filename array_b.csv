Hi, we are Harvey and Lei, a couple who love travelling, cooking. We also love children. Twenty years before we came to Kyoto, Japan as international students. Thereafter we worked, got married and had kids in Kyoto. Currently we are living in Yokohama but working at Tokyo. 

Lei’s major study was Travel and International Relationship. After graduation from university Lei worked as an independent tourist guide to help hundreds of tourists worldwide. Harvey worked as a senior managing officer in a major company. As we like travelling, we have loved this country and its beautiful and unique culture. We have a dream for many years, that is to help tourists know more about Japanese culture, scenery and gourmet. Eventually we decided to quit our jobs and establish our own travel business.

We fully understand that accommodation plays an important role in travelling. It can also help foreign tourists to know more local culture and customs. Our place is a kind of Japanese ‘home-style’ hotel with clean, safe, comfortable and elegant environment. Staying with us, you will feel home sweet and safe after a tired day tour.

We look forward to creating the most memorable stay for you during your time in Japan.

Hello! I am a Web Producer, Digital Branding & Marketing specialist, Event Production Coordinator, TV media interpreter (yes I wear many hats!) and a long-time resident of Shinjuku. I'm also the co-host/local correspondent of the popular ""Doko Ga TV: JapanMania,"" an exciting, fun, family friendly Japanese lifestyle & travel TV show filmed in Japan and airing on Hawaii television KFVE the Home Team Ch.05. 

I was raised in the Philippines, attended schools in Japan and the United States and have been traveling frequently to Hawaii for work and R&R. I am an avid traveler and always in pursuit of planning the next journey. I have great love for movies, food, traveling, swimming, body-boarding, music or just sharing great conversation with friends around dinner tables. 

We have thought of everything to make your stay exceptionally memorable and an enjoyable retreat. We have also traveled a great deal in our lifetime and understand the frustrations tourists can experience, so when you're staying with us, we're always at your disposal. Just feel free to ask ANYTHING! :-)

We're also very laid back, sociable, friendly and we really enjoy meeting new people. We also love to share our favorite places to eat, drink and visit in the city with our guests. I work out of home and will be around all day and some evenings. So, if you need company, we will try to make ourselves available. But we're also happy to give you as much privacy and time alone as you would like. Your call! :-)  Your hosts are me and my mother, either of us (or sometimes both!) will be around all day.

I'm also quite a foodie and I love trying out new foods, places to eat in the city. So if you're looking for good places to eat or just wanna have a fun wicked night in the neighborhood, feel free to ask me.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fb149793-5417-4172-83a8-83fd1a6b115d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fb149793-5417-4172-83a8-83fd1a6b115d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Shinjuku District,3,3,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Shinjuku-ku, Tōkyō-to, Japan",Shinjuku Ku,,35.69875,139.69112,Entire home,Entire home/apt,3,1.0,1 bath,1.0,3.0,"[""Ethernet connection"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Dryer"", ""Bed linens"", ""TV"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Oven"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Hangers"", ""Heating"", ""Pocket wifi"", ""Toaster"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Microwave"", ""Freezer"", ""Rice maker"", ""Bidet"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Coffee maker: pour-over coffee"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Shampoo"", ""Private entrance"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Host greets you"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Bathtub"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Kitchen"", ""Stove"", ""Washer"", ""Iron"", ""Hot water"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Essentials"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""First aid kit"", ""Wifi"", ""Cleaning products""]","$33,571.00",1,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,t,0,1,1,1,2025-03-24,162,1,1,1,0,6,201426.0,2015-08-16,2025-03-24,4.98,4.97,5.0,4.99,4.99,4.83,4.95,M130048161,f,3,3,0,0,1.39

I am Rumika, a mother of loveable 1 year old boy.
I was born and raised in Hatsudai. 
(This area is one station from Shinjuku station.) 
I still live in this area with my family. 
Hatsudai can easily access the areas of Shinjuku, Shibuya, Nakano, Tsukiji market, Roppongi, Aoyama. It is a very convenient place. 
Although it is one station from Shinjuku, many locals live. I think that it is a very safe area. 
The shopping area is also a 1-minute walk away. Supermarkets and convenience stores are a 3-minute walk away. There are also many local eateries.
